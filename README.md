**The aim of this project is to develop a model that accurately predicts diabetes Classes(0,1,2) and aims to classify Diabetes classes using various Machine Learning Models from the Scikit-Learn Library namely k-Nearest Neighbors(kNN), Support Vector Machine(SVM), Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier(C4.5 and CART) with Cost-Complexity Pruning as to explore the impact of Cost Complexity Pruning on decision tree models, aiming to strike a balance between model complexity and performance.Projectâ€™s chosen evaluation metrics are F1-score and Macro-Averaging Techniques for analyzing the performance of each of the classifiers and the designed model.**
